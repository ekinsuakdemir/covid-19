## Introduction

Investigating which countries have the highest numner of Covid-19 hospitalizations against cumilative number of positive cases

## Understanding Data

Here, I use a dataset from Kaggle, which was collected between the 20th of January and the 1st of June 2020.

```{r}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)

covid_df <- read_csv("covid19.csv")

#Determine dimensions of covid_df by using function dim()
dim(covid_df)

#Determine the colmun names of covid_df using the colnames()function

vector_cols <-colnames(covid_df)
print(vector_cols)

# Use head() or glimpse () to see if there are inconsistencies. 
head(covid_df)
glimpse(covid_df)
```


## Cleaning the Data

Province_State column has data from country level and state level. Clean this dataframe so that it has data only on country level.


```{r}
covid_df_all_states <- covid_df %>%  filter(Province_State == "All States") %>%
  select(-Province_State)
glimpse(covid_df_all_states)
```

Daily data should be seperated from the cumilative data. 

```{r}
covid_df_all_states_daily <- covid_df_all_states %>% select(Date, Country_Region, active, daily_tested, daily_positive, hospitalizedCurr)

```

My goal is to extract hospitilizations and cases data by top 10 countries. 

```{r}
#Group columns by Country_Region with group_by() and summarize() functions and arrange it in descending order with arrange()
covid_df_all_states_sum <- covid_df_all_states_daily %>% group_by(Country_Region) %>%
  summarize(hospitalized = sum(hospitalizedCurr), positive = sum(daily_positive), active = sum(active), tested=sum(daily_tested), proportion_hosp_positive= hospitalized/positive, proportion = positive/tested) %>% 
              arrange(desc(tested))
              
covid_top_10 <- head(covid_df_all_states_sum, 10)
```

##Getting vectors
Extract the vectors from the covid_top_10 dataframe

```{r}

countries <- covid_top_10$Country_Region
tested_cases <- covid_top_10$tested
positive_cases <- covid_top_10$positive
active_cases <- covid_top_10$active
hospitalized_cases <- covid_top_10$hospitalized

```
##Naming vectors

```{r}
names(positive_cases) <- countries
names(tested_cases) <- countries
names(active_cases) <- countries
names(hospitalized_cases) <- countries
```

##Identifying top three positive against tested cases.

```{r}
positive_cases
sum(positive_cases)
mean(positive_cases)
positive_cases/sum(positive_cases)
positive_tested_top_3 <- c("United States" = 0.6,"Italy" = 0.08, "Russia" = 0.1)
```
